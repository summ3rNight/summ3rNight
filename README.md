### ðŸ’» Programming Experience

- **Java:** Extensive experience gained through university projects and practical exercises, mastering core concepts (data structures, algorithms, OOP, concurrency) and software engineering principles (design patterns, layered architectures). Applied in significant projects including a mathematical/image processing library with a JavaFX UI, and a client-server application utilizing Spring Boot for the REST API and JavaFX for the client.

- **C++ & C:** In-depth knowledge of modern C++ and C, focusing on system-level programming and performance. Expertise covers memory management (RAII, smart pointers), STL, templates, lambdas, and concurrency (pthreads, `std::thread`, mutexes). Gained extensive practical experience in performance analysis and optimization (profiling with `perf`, Valgrind/Callgrind), utilizing AVX/SIMD intrinsics, cache-aware programming, compiler optimizations, Makefiles, and debugging with GDB (as per courses like "Basics of C++" and a performance programming practicum). Key projects include an external sort utility and various performance-optimized algorithms.

- **Databases & SQL:** basic understanding of relational database systems, including conceptual, logical, and physical database design, complex SQL query formulation (DML/DDL), relational algebra, transaction management, recovery, and security aspects. Practical experience gained through dedicated database coursework.

- **Linux & Bash:** Proficient with Linux (Ubuntu) as a primary development environment for C/C++, Java, and other projects. Experienced with Bash scripting for task automation, build process management, system navigation, and package management.

- **Software Engineering Methodologies:** Solid grasp of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), including requirements engineering, system modeling, various architectural patterns (Client-Server, Layered, Microservices), design patterns, diverse testing strategies (unit, integration, TDD), and CI/CD principles, based on comprehensive software engineering coursework.
